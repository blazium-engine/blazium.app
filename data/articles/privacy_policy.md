We encourage you to review their privacy policies before providing any personal information.

To enhance your experience, we use third-party services (e.g., Miro boards, TimeGraphics timelines, YouTube videos) that may collect personal data, such as your IP 
address and usage information. A cookie notice will appear when you visit our website, allowing you to accept or decline cookies for enabling third-party embeds. By 
default, these embeds are disabled unless you accept the cookies.

When interacting with third-party content, the services may collect:

If you decline, only placeholders will appear, giving you the option to enable these services and cookies later.
