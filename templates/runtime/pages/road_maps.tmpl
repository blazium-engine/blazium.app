    <h1>Road Maps</h1>
    <p>
      The goal is simple: provide a clear vision for the future of Blazium for the community to debate, decide, and
      shape.<br>
      We value transparencyâ€”if you know what we're doing, we'll understand what you want.<br>
      That's what being a community is all about.
